<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 15, 2026</p>

<p>FuelIQ ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the FuelIQ mobile application ("App").</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and password (securely hashed). You may optionally provide your name.</p>

<p><strong>Health & Fitness Data:</strong> To provide core App functionality, we collect data you voluntarily enter, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Food and nutrition logs (calories, macronutrients, micronutrients)</li>
  <li>Body measurements (weight, body fat percentage, measurements)</li>
  <li>Workout and exercise data</li>
  <li>Water intake</li>
  <li>Fasting schedules</li>
  <li>Sleep data</li>
  <li>Mood and journal entries</li>
  <li>Progress photos (stored locally on your device)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Device Health Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, FuelIQ may read data from Apple Health (iOS) or Health Connect (Android), including steps, active calories, heart rate, and weight. We only read data types you authorize.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous analytics to improve the App, including screen views and feature usage. This data cannot be linked to your identity.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide and personalize the App's nutrition tracking, workout planning, and health insights</li>
  <li>To generate AI-powered recommendations and meal plans (Premium subscribers only)</li>
  <li>To calculate your TDEE, macronutrient targets, and fitness scores</li>
  <li>To send notifications you have opted into (meal reminders, streak warnings, fasting alerts)</li>
  <li>To maintain your streak, achievements, and gamification progress</li>
  <li>To improve App performance and fix bugs</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. AI Processing</h2>
<p>Premium subscribers may use AI-powered features (chat, meal plans, workout generation, food scanning, voice logging). When you use these features, relevant context (such as your nutrition goals, recent food logs, and health metrics) is sent to our secure server for processing. AI interactions are not used to train AI models. You can delete your AI interaction history at any time.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your data is stored securely using Supabase (hosted on AWS) with row-level security policies</li>
  <li>Sensitive credentials are stored in your device's secure enclave via Expo SecureStore</li>
  <li>All network communication uses HTTPS with certificate pinning</li>
  <li>We implement request signing, rate limiting, and input validation</li>
  <li>Progress photos are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to our servers</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. We share data only with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database and authentication provider</li>
  <li><strong>Google Gemini:</strong> AI processing for Premium features only</li>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management (receives only purchase receipts, not health data)</li>
  <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> Crash reporting (receives only anonymized error data)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access</strong> your data via the App's export feature (CSV and PDF formats)</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and all associated data from Settings</li>
  <li><strong>Opt out</strong> of notifications at any time</li>
  <li><strong>Revoke</strong> health data permissions through your device settings</li>
  <li><strong>Request</strong> a copy of your data by contacting us</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, all personal data is permanently removed from our servers within 30 days. Anonymous, aggregated analytics data may be retained indefinitely.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
